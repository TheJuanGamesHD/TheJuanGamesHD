## Hi there 👋

- I am fascinated by everything related to the military and the technology it uses.
- I focus on how military technology helps humans in their evolution.
- Right now I am working on creating an AI with the reasoning of being a weapon that can be integrated into a system for human survival. I mean that an unmanned drone can help the human pilot as a support hive, or the implementation of an AI robot like R2D2 within the same cabin that complements the pilot or in general in the vehicles that can and will be implemented.
- My main concentration now is intelligent protection like Israel's Iron Dome but that focuses on hidden systems, since I focus on the US.
